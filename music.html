        <p>I&rsquo;m heavily jazz influenced, love classical impressionism, but am also math and composition
           obsessed and have spent decades down the rabbithole of harmony and sound trying to manifest
           and cherry pick sounds that I loved and collect them into music that is probably unlistenable
           for most people.</p>
        <p>I have an unhealthily large collection of weird effects pedals I&rsquo;m constantly tweaking,
           and a love for vintage tones and warmth coupled with sonic novelty. I like sweetness,
           quirkiness, dissonance, catchiness, and humor in music and am obsessed with nailing a sweet
           spot there that probably doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

            <h3>Poolrooms</h3>
            <p>I challenged myself to start an album with visual imagery as the inspiration. I generated
               images of vibey pool rooms and then improvised to try to conjure the vibes I was feeling.
               Bottled the juju and here we are with 2 mixtape-inspired tracks meant to just steamily
               steep yourself inside in the background of your wet, hazy, bath-tiled, dreamy day.</p>

            <h3>Susurrus Glee</h3>
            <p>Me trying my best to make something that sounded more like &ldquo;songs&rdquo; and not a
               meandering landscape of intensely evolving improvisation. Catchy and somewhat dancey bits
               about, probably my most &ldquo;colorful&rdquo; and memorable tunes are in here. Quirky and
               beat-centric, built around the most weird-yet-usable guitar sounds I could conjure at the
               time. All guitar, bass, drums, (maybe some light vocals) and way too many effects pedals.</p>

            <h3>Psychedelala</h3>
            <p>This was all about capturing guitar sounds. At the time I was really into the Chase Bliss
               Habit and Blooper and these dominate the album. I&rsquo;m always trying to use these
               bleep-bloop machines in a song-ish context, so this is my early effort to take all my
               bedroom sound experimentations and get them into a more listenable format. Some of these
               definitely take you on a trip, hence the name.</p>

            <h3>Fine Shiny Sunbunny Day</h3>
            <p>This album was the first one after a long spell of not finishing anything. I decided to
               ditch my previous vocal centered concept and just play the guitar. Long, winding epic jams
               meant to be listenable and repeatable. I put together the most insane chain of stereo effects
               I possibly could and limited myself to exactly 1 track each of guitar, bass, and drums to
               see how big of a sound I could make with just a trio concept.</p>
            <p>Most of it was recorded during a months-long struggle with insomnia; I&rsquo;d often wake
               up at 3AM unable to get back to sleep so&hellip; I&rsquo;d zombie into my recording room
               and get lost in pedals and improv for hours. I still really like this album&mdash;I think
               it captured that period of my playing well.</p>
